Nevertheless, from the Southern Observatory, he was able to perform 76 measurements to 34 stars in one of the two directions and 93 to 39 stars in the other.

In order to determine the deflection resulting from the mountain, it was necessary to include the curvature of the earth's surface: for the observer, the local zenith changes like the latitude on which it is located. After taking into account other effects such as precession, aberration and nutation, mask showed that the difference between the local certain zenith was in the observation north and south of the schie lion 54,6 arcseconds.

He said that a distraction of 20,9 arcseconds would be expected, if the middle dense of the schie and the earth were the same. Since the actual distraction corresponded to about half of this value, it could estimate the medium density of the earth to approximately the double value of that of the schie lion.

"{'context': 'Similar to almost all other non-Bird-Dinosaurs investigated, plateosaurus grew according to a pattern that is different from that of the mammals and the bird-like dinosaurs. The closely related sauropods, which showed a dinosaur typical of dinosaurs, grew very quickly and continued their growth after maturity with a somewhat depressed rate. However, the growth of the sauropods was determinat (Limited) - so the animals reached a stage in which they barely grew further. Mammals are also growing very quickly, but their maturity is usually more or less combined with the reaching of the growth stop. in both groups, the final is quite constant. Today\'s lizard shows a sauropods-like pattern, with initial growth in growth, then a reduction of the rate about maturity, and a minimal growth in the age. However, their initial rate is much smaller than that of mammals, birds and dinosaur. In addition, it is subjected to strong fluctuations, so that individuals of the same age can reach significantly different sizes and the achieved growth rate also varies strongly. in today\'s living animals, this pattern is associated with a behavior-Tied Thermoregulation and a low metabolism (poi kilo thermie and the) and is called development plasticity (developmental of). Plateosaurus followed a trajectory similar to sauropods, but a variable growth rate and final as shown in today\'s lizards and snakes, probably in response to environmental variables such as the food. Some individuals were growing at lengths of only 4,8 meters, others reached 10 meters length. The Cellular of the bones suggests fast growth, as is known by sauropods and mammals, which indicates endo thermie. Thus, plateosaurus is probably an early stage in the development of the endo thermie, in which it was separate from the development of the development. This hypothesis is based on a detailed study of the long-Bone Histology of Martin Sander and Nicole Klein. For an endo of plateosaurus, the well-known lung, from air bags, also speaks to which the breathing volume can be closed. Using Bone Histology, the age of an individual can also be assess. Similar to the jahresringen of trees, growth brands in the bone are viewed as a expression of different strong growth during the course of a year. The number of growth brands thus provides evidence of the minimum age of the corresponding individual. However, increasing age is becoming increasingly absorbed (""dissolved""), which has lost older growth brands, so that a only difficult number of years has to be added. For example, in long bones of the thickest, there is still visible growth ring in order to close from the diameter of the mark cave to the maximum number of growth brands. with this method, the age of the animal is likely to overestimate a bit. Sander and klein found out in this way that some individuals of plateosaurus were already growing with at least 12 years, while others were still growing slowly with at least 20 years. A Specimen Must therefore have grown relatively quickly with at least 18 years. The age of most animals investigated in this respect was at the entrance of the death between 12 and 20 years old. The oldest individual was about 27 years old. However, it is believed that plateosaurus could achieve an even higher age, since the animals, which were the subject of this analysis, did not die of dotage, but were lost in a swamp. Because animals are missing under 4,8 meters of age, it is not possible to create a complete growth series of plateosaurus or to measure the growth rates in the first ten years of life.', 'question': 'How big was the smallest one?', 'answers': {'answer_start': [1515], 'text': ['4,8 meters']}, 'id': 'af45a5f7dfd08b865c21d08ce6660d5a8ae957fb'}"

"{'context': 'The teams of fc arsenal have mostly worn red jerseys with white sleeves and equally white pants at the home, but this tradition has quite a lot of gaps over time. The Red color has been fixed shortly after the association in 1886, basically in recognition for the donation of the first jersey sentence of Nottingham Forest. With Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, two of the members were former players of this association and later moved to woolwich. When they were able to get a team and did not get any and, they were able to help in writing from their home and received the desired jersey sentences and a ball.

Herbert Chapman wanted to modernise in 1933 and pleaded for a concise colourway. The Red Jerseys now put the sleeves white off and the red resembled more of how it was used for the mailboxes of the British Royal mail. The Origin of the idea about the white sleeves could not be fully reconstructed so far, with two possible inspirations mostly speculated. The first variant tells about a grandstands viewer that chapman saw and who wore a white shirt under a red sweater. The other story reports that Chapman was inspired by a similar clothing of the famous cartoonist Tom Webster, with which the coach of fc arsenal occasionally played golf. The fc arsenal later wore this combination apart from two times of the year.

The Limulus-Lysate-discovered test can also be positive in meningitis due to meningitis, but also it should only be used if other test methods do not provide a result of the result. Using the polymerase chain reaction, dna of viruses and bacteria can be reproduced in vitro, so as to detect small amounts of bacteria in the liquor fluid. The sensitivity and specificity of this study are very high because traces of pathogen dna are sufficient for identification. This study can therefore be an essential help in the differentiation of genital or pathogen-Free Pathogen (for example, in case of herpes simplex, herpes simplex-2 viruses and also mumps in case of genital persons). Titre Studies (Antigen Antibody Reactions in vitro) may be helpful in viral antibody reactions.

The BMI of the child is compared in tables with the data of other children of the same age. The World Health organization gives out bmi tables for boys and girls.

For Germany, the altersperzentilen published by the association of obesity in the children's and children's Association (Aga) are recommended for the assessment of BMI. As reference values, current body weight and body weight data from girls and boys aged 0 to 18 are used from different regions of Germany.

Underweight is a child then if only 10 % (10. Age percentile) or less have a lower BMI, as a strong BMI, a BMI is considered below the 3. Age percentile.

If according to definition, exactly 15 % of all children are overweight, for example, you can't get to the statement, 25 % of all children are overweight. The limits of a suitable BMI are strongly related to the state of development of the child. For example, the rapid length growth in the start of puberty and similar is shown.

After today's assumption, in the center of all galaxies, there is a very velorum black hole, which can include several million to billions of galaxies. Active galaxies differ from normal galaxies by increasing this black hole with time to mass, because matter from the surrounding galaxy (Interstellar gas or torn stars) is attracted by the gravity of the black hole. This process of the ansammelns of matter is called in astronomy accretion. Due to the spin preservation of the incident matter, it can not fall directly into the black hole, so that a akkretionsscheibe is formed around this one. With Friction, this disc heats up, while parts of the matter can lose spin and fall into the black hole in the same way. the emission of the travemunde akkretionsscheibe is what is observed as a typical radiation of the quasar. It can reach a luminosity similar to that of many billion stars and thus more light than the entire surrounding wirtsgalaxie. the luminous quasars reach the power of more than 1014 times. However, the observation of the quasar q0957+ 561 showed that this one does not contain a black hole in the center, but can be better explained by an object of the type meco.

"{'context': 'Following the founding of the Chinese people\'s Republic on 1. October 1949, the strategy of "" new democracy "" looked at a long-term hold on mixed media. The Chinese economy should only gradually be transformed into a "" socialist radical members of the politburo criticised this already in 1951. From 1953, the new guideline saw a "" Socialist Transformation "" of the economy, which was oriented towards Stalin\'s programme of 1929 under the keyword "" learning from the Soviet Union!"" the principle of central planning and leadership of production, investment, distribution and consumption has been included. at the same time with the end of the Korean, the first five-year plan was adopted in 1953 according to Soviet pattern. In Parallel, it came to the formation of a new Elite Elite: while about two million officials worked for the national in 1948, the communist state and state government in 1958 had over eight million squads. Even before the official founding of the people\'s Republic of China, reform had been initiated, but a country of land had not taken place, even if the ccp with leaflets and pamphlets had the opportunity to promote the benefits of such a collectivization mao was fundamentally of the opinion that larger production units would automatically lead to higher mechanization and thus higher returns. On the other hand, other members of the party, such as liu shaoqi, were of the opinion that a large number of agricultural machinery would only be useful if china had a sufficient number of agricultural machinery. China did not have its own industry for the production of agricultural machinery at this time, the first production process began to produce only in 1958 from 1952 to 1957, the collectivization of agriculture was driven by a change of intensity, with mao zedong, with his desire for a far-reaching and fast climate change towards moderate members in the politburo. The first agricultural trade fair started in 1952 and saw mergers from six to nine households. The second phase began in 1955 and was later called the "" low collectivization usually, the families of a village formed a great cooperative. the farmers have not yet lost their land, but they were forced to use draught, devices and seeds together, under the direction of a small group in small groups to order the fields and share the yields. For those who had benefited from the reform, this was economically little appealing. Those who owned, killed them and sold the meat, because this was more powerful than to provide the animal of the cooperative. Joining the cooperative was theoretically voluntary, but it was often forced, in which the families planned for the merger were called to a meeting and were not allowed to leave it until they agreed to join the cooperative. As farmers in 1955 had the opportunity to return from the cooperative, the leadership party in Beijing was surprised by the large number of farmers who made use of this opportunity. The first collectivization aspirations led to higher agricultural income due to larger plots and more intensified use of agricultural equipment. However, there has been far-reaching resistance in the rural population, which occasionally expressed itself in local uprisings. After the further efforts of the collectivization in January 1955 were temporarily suspended, they were intensified again as of April 1955 after a trip through the southern provinces, mao came to the conclusion that reports on resistance in the population were exaggerated. He himself said that 50 percent of the rural population should be part of a collective towards the end of the year. In the province and region of Germany, the collectivization was driven much faster than by mao. In the spring of 1956, 92 percent of rural households were collective connected, while at the beginning of 1955, they were only 14 percent. In December 1956, only three percent of the rural population managed to cultivate their country individually. In the last collectivization stage, farmers were increasingly no longer compensated for possession that they had brought into the collective, but only paid for the work they did. During the collectivization in the country, there was a climate change where millions moved to the cities. In 1956, the country was introduced in China, which should largely prevent this climate change. Farmers were no longer able to accept contract work during the winter months outside of their region, to visit markets or to reap sufficient harvests in regions with sufficient harvests. The industry and services industry, both of which were very much smaller compared to the agricultural sector, began after the close-up of the agricultural industry and went very fast. It was already completed in January 1956 in all major cities. During the "" low collectivization "" the farmers had to sell a set of cereals to the government at a fixed price, the rest of which could also be sold on the free market. According to Soviet economic authority, a industrialization of the people\'s Republic was only to finance a taxation of the agricultural sector. example of this was not only the economic development of the Soviet Union, but also japan, where 60 percent of the financial resources necessary for industrialization were levied on a taxation of the agricultural sector. The creation of a state grain monopoly was the easiest way to ensure the financing of industrialization. About five percent of the country was allowed to be farmed by families as private plots, which resulted in the families primarily taking care of these plots.

About 8.000 tons of haiflossen are processed every year, with the fins only about 4 percent of the body weight of a shark. This means that around 200.000 tons of sharks will be thrown back into the sea. According to specialists, the worldwide climate change will collapse on sharks within the next decade through the longline fishing. Due to the strong overfishing, stocks have no chance to regenerate. A basic problem of sharks is their slow rate. Many species need 25 to 30 years until they reach the maturity of their lives. After that, they only get descendants every two years. The impact on the respective ecosystems is not at the moment. In particular, the parts of the population that use the shark as a shark will also be obstructed sustainably in their often traditional food. Especially in the developing countries, this will lead to a further tightening of food shortages.

Since 1966, Cambodia has sold about 100.000 tons of rice to the Vietnamese people's army, which offered the price and paid in us dollars. However, the nva government paid only a low, fixed price, allowing Cambodia to break enormous revenue. In addition, the remaining price of 583.700 tons in 1965 broke to 199.049 tonnes in the following year, as farmers on the black market were significantly higher than the prices fixed by the government. On September 11., the first free elections were held in Cambodia. Due to massive infiltration and voter interference, the conservatives managed to win a total of 75 percent of the seats in the National Assembly. As a result, lon nol was elected prime minister and sirik matak, an ultra-avowed member of the royal family and declared opponent sihanouk, to his deputy.

Lon Nols\'s first goal was to consolidate the economy on the ground by pre-order to prevent the black market from selling rice to the communist forces in the country. For this purpose, soldiers were sent to the main regions that monitored the harvest. the farmers were allowed to sell their rice only to these rice farmers and only received the low price set by the government. This LED to extensive unrest, whose center was in the rice rich province of Battambang, where the communists were partly very influential. This was because there were many landowners in the province and the income was very big. On March 11., 1967, while at the state visit in France, he broke an open uprising in the district of Sam, according to Battambang, as the villagers were attacked by a group of tax attacks. Probably due to the support and incitement of local communist squads, the uprising quickly spread over the whole region. Lon nol reacted to this uprising by applying martial law. During the oppression of the rebellion hundreds of civilians were killed and several villages were completely destroyed. Due to this insurrection, after his return at the end of March, he decided to change his previous balance policy and ordered the arrest of khieu samphan, hou yuon and hu nim, the leaders of the "" government "", however, all three managed to escape to the northeast of the country, in which the central government did not actually hold government power. at the same time, he ordered the arrest of Chinese Rice Exporters, which organized the illegal rice trade and caused enormous losses to the state. He fulfilled a long-standing demand from the conservatives. As a next step, dismissed lon nol from his office and appointed a new government from rather left-wing politicians, who should form a counterbalance to the conservatives of the conservatives in the National Assembly. The acute oppression was overcome, however, the Sam loud uprising and its brutal oppression led to the fact that thousands of new recruits joined the communist party of Cambodia, from sihanouk simply Khmer Rouge (Red Khmer) and the name lon nols in large parts of the population became synonymous with brutal oppression.', 'question': 'Whose government tried to criticize the prince?', 'answers': {'answer_start': [329], 'text': ['government lon nols']}, 'id': '538a659f2d311a5ed75accaa70ce31b665a9effa'}"

"{'context': 'Under the influence of poincaré\'s demand for the undetectable of an absolute movement, Lorentz (1904 b) finally came very close to a completion of his theorem of the appropriate states. He developed a field theoretical concept of electrons, as well as Abraham, but in contrast to Abraham, he tried to take into account the contraction of electrons and thus the relativity. by using the electromagnetic pulse, he was able to explain the negative result of the trou-Noble Experiment (1903) where a torque was expected due to the aether wind. Similarly, the negative results of the experiments of Rayleigh and brace (1902, 1904) could be explained for the final examination. Another important step was to extend the validity of the lorentz transformation to non-Electric forces (if these exist). However, lorentz did not manage to show the full lorentz-covariance of the electromagnetic equations. Approximately at the same time as lorentz designed his theory, Vienna (1904 a) as in front of him searle (1897) found that due to the speed dependency of the mass, a overrun of the speed of light requires infinite energy, so it is impossible. and after he had the final version of lorentz\'s theory, he (1904 b) closed the same from the length contraction, because the length of a body would accept an imaginary value in the case of a body. Abraham (1904) however, showed a fundamental defect in lorentz theory. This theory was designed in such a way that the relativity is fulfilled, but also the electromagnetic origin of all forces should be shown. Abraham showed that both assumptions are not compliant, because in the lorentz theory the contracted electrons required a non-electric energy that guarantees the stability of matter. In Abraham\'s theory of rigid electron, such energy was not necessary. The question now arises whether the electromagnetic worldview (compliant with Abraham\'s theory) or the relativity (compliant with lorentz\'s theory) was correct. Already taking into account the new theory of lorentz, Poincaré (1904) is in a speech in September in st. Louis (by connection of the galilean relativity principle with the lorentz movement of the appropriate states) the "" principle of relativity "" as a demand that the laws must be the same for all observers, regardless of whether they move or not and that\'s why you absolute movement should remain unknown. He specified his watches through light and thus his physical interpretation of the local time and explained that possibly a "" new method "" or. "" new mechanics "" will come, which is based on the insurmountable screams of the speed of light (also for relative to the aether-moving observer). He noted, however, that both the relativity, the Newton and the reactio, the masses of conservation and the conservation were not secured. In November (1904) Cohn showed possibilities for a physical interpretation of the lorentz theory (which he compared with his own). He pointed out the close connection with the measurement through standards and watches. Rest these in the lorentz aether, show the "" true "" lengths and times, and are you moved, show contracted or. Dilated values on. Like, cohn made the important statement that the local time will come when light is spreading on earth as a bullet wave, that is, the lichtausbreitung on earth is accepted as a wave of light. In contrast to lorentz and poincaré, cohn now found that the distinction between "" true "" and "" apparent "" coordinates in the lorentz theory is very artificial, because no experiment can show the true movement and all coordinates are equal to the same. On the other hand, cohn believed that all this was only valid for the field of optics, whereas mechanical watches could show the "" true "" time. Lorentz\'s essay of 1904 was in the spring of 1905 by Richard Gans in issue no. In 4, the journal beiblätter, published in the annals of physics, was summed up in detail (with the mention of the lorentz transformation), to which Albert Einstein used to contribute to the same time summaries of important international essays.

This font contained many results, but not the reasoning of its consideration, with essential parts of which were already included in two letters, which were made by poincaré ca. On May 1905, 1905, lorentz was written. He spoke of the legitimacy of the total impossibility of discovering an absolute movement, which seems to be an absolute impossibility. He recognized the group character of the lorentz transformation that he was called the first so, he gave her the modern symmetrical shape and using the relativistic speed addition, he corrected lorentz \' Terme for speed and speed and thus achieved the full lorentz-covariance. According to lorentz, he explained that the lorentz transformation (and thus the lorentz-invariance) must be applied to all the forces of nature. But unlike lorentz, he also treated the gravity and claimed the possibility of a lorentz-Invariants Gravity Model and mentioned the existence of gravitational. In order to alleviate Abraham\'s criticism, the German state of the art of the poincaré led to a non-electric pressure (the "" Poincaré "") which should guarantee the stability of the electron and may also justify the length contraction dynamically. However, the electromagnetic worldview in favor of the relativity principle was given. Finally, Poincaré (presented on 23. July, printed on 14.

For example, there are only 600 kg between the 28-Year-old specimen "" Sue "" and the 22-Year-old Canadian Specimen (rtmp 81.12.1). Another, 2004 published study supports these results and came to the result, that rapid growth began to slow down at 16 years old. This sudden deceleration of growth could indicate the reaching of maturity. This hypothesis is made by the discovery of a kalziumreichen bone in the femur (femur) of a 16 to 20 year old t. Rex from Montana (Mor 1125, also known as "" B-Rex "") - this bone is otherwise only known by female birds, who are in front of the nesting and need calcium for the formation of eggshell. This indicates that "" B-Rex "" was a mature. A new study gives an age of 18 years for this specimen. other tyranno show very similar growth, but had lower growth rates, because they didn\'t get as big as t. Rex. Over half of the well known t. Rex-specimens died within six years after the arrival of maturity; a pattern that is also found in other tyrannosaurs and in some of today\'s large birds and mammals. This species is characterized by a high mortality rate as "" babies "" followed by a relatively low mortality rate as a young person. After maturity, the mortality rate rises again, partly because of the stress that the reproduction brings with it. A study suggests that the rarity is juvenile t. Rex fossils are partly due to a low mortality rate of hatchlings; the hatchlings have not died in large numbers and therefore rarely fossilized. However, this rarity can also have other causes, such as an incomplete fossil tradition or the preference of large, spectacular finds compared to small finds by the collector.', 'question': '\\ nwelche specimens have the scientists investigated to document how fast they grow? \\ n \\ n', 'answers': {'answer_start': [-1], 'text': ['Juvenile Tyrannosaurus Rex copies']}, 'id': '822425b477384f6e877f49c9bc6063e8c7ac2b49'}"
"{'context': 'In March 2005, researchers around Mary Schweitzer announced that in the mark cave of a 68 million-Year-old leg bone was discovered by tyrannosaurus soft tissue. The Bone had to be broken for a transport and then was not subjected to the usual procedure for conservation because schweitzer hoped to test it on soft tissue. The Bone (Mor 1125) from the museum of the Rockies was previously dug up in the hell creek formation. The researchers found flexible, self-sufficient blood vessels and fibrous, but elastic bone. In these tissues and tissues, microstructures could also be detected, similar to blood cells, with the structures similarities with the blood cells and vessels of ostrich. Whether the material has been preserved by an unknown process that is different from the normal fossilisation, or whether it is the material of the material, is unknown. If it is a material-based material, using of proteins could be indirectly closed to part of the DNA Sequence, as each protein is produced by a special gene. That soft tissue has not been discovered earlier in the bones of dinosaur, it could be that researchers until today held soft soft tissue for excluded and therefore did not search for it. Since this find, tissue similar structures have been demonstrated in two other tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur. A later study found traces of the structure protein collagen in a purified tyrannosaurus bone. These studies on traditional tissues of tyrannosaurs confirm that birds are more closely related to tyrannosaurs than with other modern animals. In The 2007 study published by Chris Organ, biologist at Harvard University, and John Asara from the ""Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre"" they were able to use the preserved collagen in the upper bones found by Mary Schweitzer, based on six amino acids with 89 amino acids relatively safe to prove a phylogenetic relationship between alligators and chickens and ostrich.

In Stockholm, an animated film, consisting of eight cartoons of cartoons, was premiere in the same year. This confirmed Disney that people could also talk to a feature film. In 1935, the production of the first feature animated snow white and the seven dwarves, which used almost all the resources of the studio, began. The expected revenue was calculated to $ 1 million, which soon passed the budget of $ 1,75 million soon.

"{'context': 'The Tomb "" u "" located in umm el-Qaab (near abydos) is considered to be the most beautiful tomb. Eva-Maria Engel, in this context, refers to the very small number of only 17 there they found in contrast to the other kings. When the tomb of Petrie Petrie took the tomb in 1899, instead of a brick staircase, as known by the graves of the the and the anedjib, he discovered a 12-meter wide ramp with a gradient of 12 to the tomb of the tomb of. Degrees, about ten meters east of the tomb. Within the tomb, the ramp showed irregular stages, which had a very steep effect on the königskammer. The next to graves were partly still brush. These circumstances suggest that great time pressure is needed during the construction work, which is why the construction of the staircase has been abandoned and a ramp has been chosen. at the time of the excavations, the ramp was up to a depth of close to a meter with oil-covered oil, with its smell still full of the entire tomb. In addition to its moderation 29,2 m × 20,8 m, the plant has a simple structure, which is a new development according to the Flinders Petrie: the 67 next to the tombs of its entourage are now directly grown to the königskammer and form with it a uniform-designed tomb. Walter Bryan Emery pointed out this significant change, because according to his opinion, the upper tomb was probably the whole of the tomb. Toby Wilkinson concluded that the closest servant and kin were buried together with the king, which is why he sees the first demonstrable receipt of a planned immolation of the family members of the royal house. In addition, Wilkinson suspected that semerkhet could have taken the attempt to demonstrate his power to the life and death of his subjects in an architectural interpretation with the new architecture of the grabkomplexes. The tradition that the closest servant and kin had to follow their ruler to death ended with the burial of qas, the last king of the first dynasty. since his successor hetepsechemui, there are no longer evidence in addition to burials.

Bakr turned to abbas I., who sent him troops to help. In order to prevent a Persian occupation of Baghdad, Hafiz Ahmed Pasha immediately returned to the relationship with Bakr and thus made his loyalty safe. In response, the Persians Siege Baghdad and took it on 14. January 1624 with the help of Bakr's son Muhammad. The Case of the city followed a massacre of large parts of the Sunni population, because the shah was trying to make Baghdad a purely sunni city. The Case of Baghdad was a great, for the ottoman view. Ottoman natives and local locals started to resist.

Ripley sickened shortly after the project started, Rasmussen took over it and produced together with the graphic artist John C. Anderton birds of South Asia: the Ripley guide. the his bird guide for the Indian subcontinent was the first bestimmungsbuch for this area, which contains size. Volume 1 includes the bestimmungsbuch with more than 3400 illustrations on 180 Tablets and more than 1450 Colormap. Volume 2 (attributes and status) contains the data identification, data for identification, status, distribution and habitats. The vocalizations are described on the basis of recordings with more than 1000 Sona programmes. 1508 species that occur or have happened in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, the Maldives, the chagos archipelago and Afghanistan are treated, including 85 hypothetical and 67 \'possible\' species that are only available in India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan, briefly described. Birds of South Asia is remarkable because of its database - the authors based the information about the spread almost exclusively on malicky - and their taxonomic approach with numerous types of species. the geographical coverage is also greater than in older work, especially because Afghanistan has been taken into account. Many Allo forms, formerly considered to be a species, are treated as full species by Rasmussen and anderton. Most of them have already been proposed elsewhere, but the book led to an innovation here. The experts for Asian birds, Nigel J. Collar and John Pilgrim, analysed in 2008 the changes proposed by Rasmussen and anderton, marked, which had previously been proposed by other authors, which were new and which further investigation needs. Although the meetings in the field and hobby media press were often favorable, there were also critical voices. Peter R. Kennerley, an expert for Asian birds, held some of the illustrations for too small, grell or wrong. He also believes that the trust in sometimes very old specimens and the non-use of the rich data won by Travelers Hobby-Ornithologists is a mistake. in his opinion, many taxonomic decisions have been taken arbitrarily and not covered by the literature. Apart from the mei fraud described in the next section, and the death of s. Dillon Ripley were other problems in the production of birds of South Asia the loss of the main database for the cards during a trip to Myanmar as well as poorly prepared skins. There were also difficulties to arrange the sources to get data for ""difficult"" areas such as Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, as well as delays in the production of illustrations and cards. The Andaman Sea and the andaman sea were also a serious problem in terms of the status and taxonomy of their bird. Rasmussen discussed in an article of 2005, whether the revision of the taxonomy in this book, with its frequent split of species, would have a major impact on nature, however, meant that the impact on the vegetations in South Asia was limited. Nature Conservation is also limited, because the proportion of potentially threatened species in the region has risen from six to seven percent of the total species of species.', 'question': 'Which geographical areas provide obstacles when receiving data?', 'answers': {'answer_start': [2699], 'text': ['Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Bangladesh and Afghanistan']}, 'id': '603b2a12d7023a6077d5ec807dff5daa868676d7'}"

Both held the idea of false that cells are created by division from other cells.

Barium ions are absorbed in the musculature, the lungs and the bone, in which it is similar to calcium, but is absorbed faster. His half-life in the bone is estimated to 50 days. As a competitor of calcium on the calcium membrane, it increases the membrane permeability - at low dosage - and enhances the temperature of the membrane.

"{'context': ""The developers wanted to take over and develop the developers mainly from the predecessor. Hay brought several ideas into the planning process, which were later implemented, such as the opportunities to ride elephants, attack fortresses as particularly severely guarded places and play in an exotic mountain world with aggressive wildlife. In the rest, the free world game world should look more lively and more different than one of the key elements of the game, when it was in the predecessor. It should also offer more orders that are in a connection with the eliminated. In the design of the plot, soul ban was worth to include the elements to which the player meets in the game world, as well as in the action. This means that the criticism of the predecessor, which is more frequently expressed, should be fixed, not to harmonize sufficiently with each other's narrative and actions. The developers wanted to expand the game of the game against far cry 3 Yves Guillemot, CEO of ubisoft, saw in such a component the possibility to keep the game attractive in the long term, to achieve additional revenue by selling extensions to the game. Therefore, the design of the multiplayer mode has already been an essential element at development. A key role of the multiplayer component should take the cooperative mode, where the players fight against the royal army together in the game world. Such a mode was already planned for far cry 3 and also partially implemented, but it was deleted from the finished product for the lack of sufficient time for testing. In the design of the game world, the developers are oriented especially to Nepal and Tibet. After having decided to treat this region in the new game, some developers travelled to Nepal to explore the region and to be as credible as possible. The Studio also discussed to make the nepalese civil war on the subject of the game. However, they decided against it and instead described the story of a fictional state, because the presentation of a real event would have made the telling of an entertaining and credible act difficult. In addition, the game are not designed for this. After all, they wanted to avoid that the game seems too serious and gloomy. Great disagreement was during the development among the studios, how the game section Shangri-LA was built. The purpose of the Shangri-La sequences was to make the place of kyrat by the elaboration of its own mythology into a credible scene. Initially, it was planned to design this area like kyrat as a free-walk game world. Later, the developers made this idea, not least from time, and created a linear environment. This should be visually clear from kyrat and how an old, world-wide world looks like. The developers of the colourway of Shangri-LA are very important. This game world is mainly composed of the five colors red, gold, Orange, white and blue, of which each color has its own meaning. Gold, which serves as a background color, should convey the wealth and warmth of this paradise. Red, which was mainly used in vegetation and water, should give the place a little more natural. Orange has been used to mark important elements with which the player is supposed to interact. White, which was used for example in flags, candles and animals, should symbolise the good. Blue colors were used as a reference to dangers and therefore often come to fighting. Ubisoft has been working with the american nvidia nvidia for the development. As a result, the game for modern technologies of the company, such as temporary aliasing, has been optimized and uses nvidia physics engine physx. like his two predecessors, far cry 4 uses the dunia engine. This has been developed to take on the performance of modern hardware. However, this further development was limited by the plan to publish the game also for the older consoles Playstation 3 (Market Launch 2006) and Xbox 360 (Market Launch 2005), what the leader Stephen Mcauley in a review critical saw. On May 15., 2014, ubisoft named the estimated date 18. November of the same year.

Zhang ping assumes that such police information cover only around 25 to 30 percent of the people actually affected. Prostitution has a large share of the Chinese economy; it may deal with ten million people in an annual consumption of a trillion renminbi. According to a police campaign in 2000, Chinese economist yang fan estimated that Chinese gross domestic product fell by a percent by the unemployed female prostitutes. The Revival of prostitution took place first in the cities on the Chinese East Coast, but at the beginning of the 1990 s, the practices were also widespread in the economic hinterland, including far away and underdeveloped regions such as guizhou, yunnan and Tibet. In The 1980 s, the typical sex seller was a poorly trained, young, rural migrant from populous, relatively far away provinces such as sichuan or hunan. In the past decade, it has been noted that most women decide for prostitution. The possible benefits of prostitution as an alternative form of employment include a greater disposable income, access to higher social circles and options of lifestyle. The State-controlled media focus their attention on city cities involved in prostitution, v. A. Women with university education. The acceptance of prostitution seems to grow.

The police have occasionally been involved in the administration of quality hotels in which prostitution is taking place, or is being bribed or bribed. Brought with sexual services to ignore the activities. Corruption is also indirectly happening through the widespread misuse of public funds to finance sexual services. Pan claims that in China there is a special form of prostitution, in which there is an agreement between those who use their power and authority in the government to receive sex, and to those who receive privileges with sex. at the end of the 1990 s, it was found that more and more sex workers are physically attacked or even murdered to steal them money and possession. There is also an increasing number of crimes, in particular theft and fraud against men who buy sex, as well as bribery of public employees. The criminals benefit from the fact that their victims often do not refund due to the participation in prostitution. Organized Children's lives often run human trafficking with women to and from China, in part with violence and after several rape. In the people's Republic of China there are also more and more heroin prostitutes whose addiction is often connected to international and local criminals. Sexually transferable diseases have returned to the return of prostitution and are directly associated with it.

The mating season falls in the largest part of the range in the period from January to March, with ovulation of the females usually taking place in January or February. at the beginning of the mating season, the animals are joining groups, with several males following a mating female and fighting against each other. As soon as the female has chosen a male, the couple lives monogamous and together in a construction. the iriomote lasts 52 to 60 days and the earliest births (litters) are falling in mid-March, most of them in April. The litters usually comprise five to six pups, but the margin ranges from two to ten puppies. Since it comes to bigger litter, especially in years with high food availability, there is probably a connection between litter size and availability of food. The newborn hatchlings have a maximum weight of 130 to 140 millimeters at a weight of 60 to 65 grams. They are blind and deaf and have a soft and soft fur with a monochrome tail; the adult coloring will only be available during further development. The eyes are open after about 14 to 16 days. After about 28 days, the hatchlings can eat meat for the first time. From Mid-may, the hatchlings will be out of construction for the first time. After the litter, the female lives alone with the hatchlings for about two months, while the male refers to its own construction or simply lives outside of the construction; however, it participates both in feeding and protecting the hatchlings. The females change the construction with the little ones during this time up to two-or three times when it comes to pests. It is also possible for two females to live in a construction together with their throw, and also help with young rearing by peers. After the weaned of the puppies, the female can use the male to build a construction, while the pups remain in the litter of the litter alone. The growth and development of the hatchlings is very fast, already after four months they have reached the size of the parents. You can reach the maturity after nine months, so that you can get back for the first time at the end of your first year of life. Usually the hatchlings leave the parental construction, but usually remain close to them and can return to the autumn and winter season as well. One of the main factors of mortality in pups under construction includes diseases and diseases, and possibly ants who attack the helpless puppies according to hunters.

"{'context': 'On December 21., 1801, William Godwin married Mary Jane Clairmont, who lived in the neighborhood and who was pregnant by him. She had the view among her neighbors that she was a widow. The two children, who brought them to marriage, were born illegitimate and were born by two different fathers. Fanny imlay was seven years old at the time of marriage. Her new step siblings were the three-Year-old Claire and the six-Year-old Charles Clairmont. Although Mary Jane Clairmont had enjoyed an extensive education and traveled far, most people from William Godwins\'s environment felt his new wife as vulgar and dishonest. Many of them were astonished that William Godwin had chosen her as a new partner after marriage with Mary Wollstonecraft. William st. Clair, one of the biographer of the Shelley-and the Godwin family, points to the risk that a biographer has the opinion of those who have written them down. The acceptance of Mary Jane Clairmont can therefore have been bigger than the preserved testimonies are hinting. Fanny imlay and her half-Sister Mary Godwin, however, had a long-term relationship with their stepmother and were often told that they prefer their own children to them. The child who had been the occasion for the marriage died at birth. On March 28., 1803, William Godwin came to the world with William Godwin, who was raised in the Godwin household. to what extent William Godwin followed the education principles required by Mary Wollstonecraft, it is controversial. William Godwin Las fanny imlay and his daughter Mary Godwin, from Sarah Trimmer\'s fantastic histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbaulds teaching for children (1778-1779). Otherwise, according to fanny imlays\'s bio, he undertook a few efforts to give the two girls a good education. The books that Mary Wollstonecraft had written for her daughter fanny, he ignored. William st. Clair has argued in his biography of the Godwin and the Shelley family that William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft have had long discussions about what education their children should receive. These discussions are also reflected in William Godwins\'s book the enquirer. After Mary Wool\'s death, William Godwin even recorded correspondence with lady mount cashell, who used to be one of the learners of wollstonecraft, and asked her for advice on how he should educate his daughters. Miranda Seymour also joins the opinion of William st. Godwin in her biography about Mary Godwin. Clair on and argues that "" everything we know about the early years of his daughters suggests that they were raised in a way that would have agreed to their mother."" Miranda Seymour refers to the two having a governess, one tutor, a French speaking stepmother and a (Step-) Father, who wrote children\'s books and usually made the first designs of his own offspring first. However, it was the new stepmother, who mainly took over the education of children, and her daughter Claire Clairmont received the most complete education. She learned more than just basic knowledge in French as the only one of the girls. In view of the financial situation of the Godwin household, Solid French knowledge would have been necessary for both fanny imlay and Mary Godwin to be able to find their way out of the house one day. While Claire Clairmont and Mary Godwin at least temporarily visited a vassar, fanny imlay was only taught at home. Nevertheless, c describes.

In 1924, the sansevieria was taken by the museum Henry Fairfield Osborn as a velociraptor. The Name Velociraptor means as much as "" fast robbers "" (Lat.: Velox - "" fast "", raptor - "" robbers ""), while the species name mongoliensis is indicating the country of Mongolia where the fossils were found. Earlier in the same year, Osborn named the new species in a press article "" Ovoraptor Djadochtari "" (not to be confused with oviraptor); however, since this name has not been published in a scientific magazine or by a formal description, it is considered according to the international rules for the zoological nomenclature (Iczn) as a "" naked name "" ("" naked name ""), which is why the name is a priority for the velociraptor. While North American researchers were not allowed to enter the Communist Mongolia in the cold war, Soviet, polish and mongolian researchers discovered more skeletons. In 1971, the famous fossil of the "" struggling dinosaurs "" was discovered by a polish-Mongolian Research Team (Prints Gin 100/25), which shows a velociraptor during a fight with a proto cera tops. It is considered to be the National Museum of Mongolia, but was lent to the American Museum of natural history in New York in 2000 for a temporary exhibition. Today it is at the National Museum of natural history in ulaanbaatar. Between 1988 and 1990, a Chinese-Canadian team discovered remains of velociraptor in China. American scientists returned to Mongolia in 1990 and this is how a Mongolian-American team discovered several well-preserved skeletons. In 1999, a Chinese-Belgian team discovered a upper jaw and a tears of tears, which were part of the velociraptor, but are atypical for the type type of velociraptor. Researchers around Pascal Godefroit described this find 2008 as a holo type of a new species, velociraptor osmolskae.

Over all these years, however, his information about his assets has never really been verifiable and therefore an object of controversy. In 1976, when the New York times brought an article about him, he claimed to have a wealth of $ 200 million. In the same year, he paid his income to almost $ 25.000, and in 1978 and 1979 he gave a negative income of a total of 3,8 million. In this period, he took a loan of the chase Manhattan bank over 35 million and took another 7,5 million away from his father.

This year it was announced that trump had debt of several billion, and Forbes turned him down to 500 million, which left him out of the list. Instead, the magazine dedicated to him an article in which his debts were portrayed and that he had major problems to make ongoing payments (cash flow). Six years in a row, he no longer appeared in the Forbes list (CF. On Top: Casino in Atlantic City and difficult 1990 s). during his entire career, trump was legally opposed to people and organizations who were critical of his career as an extremely successful entrepreneur and his alleged wealth. An example that attracted special attention is his conflict with the New York times author Timothy O \' Brien. This one was expressed in his 2005 book trump nation. The Art of being the Donald, based on copious interviews with trump and employees of its company, is sceptical about the most detailed information about trump\'s assets.

"{'context': ""Bartholdi and laboulaye have asked how the idea of freedom is best to implement. In the early American history, there were two cultural symbols as cultural symbols of the nation. Columbia was considered a world leader in the United States, similar to Marianne in France. She had replaced the former figure of an Indian Princess, which was now considered uncivilized and offensive for the Americans. The other important female in the American culture was an embodiment of freedom, derived from the freiheitsgöttin, which was adored in the Roman Empire, especially by enslaved slaves. A freedom figure influenced the most American Coins of that time and influenced numerous works of art, including Thomas Crawfords's statue of freedom on the dome of the capitol. A freedom figure was also on the great seal of France. Artists of the 18. th and 19. th century, who wanted to represent Republican ideals, often attacked an embodiment of freedom. Bartholdi and laboulaye avoid the image of a revolutionary freedom, for example in the painting the freedom leads to the people of eugène delacroix. In this painting, which reminds of the French Revolution of 1830, the bared and violent freedom leads an armed crowd. Laboulaye did not have any sympathies for revolutions and therefore wished a fully held figure in billowing robe. Instead of the violent appearance in the work of, bartholdi wanted to give the statue a peaceful appearance, which is why she should wear a torch as a symbol of progress. Crawfords's statue originally wore a pileus, a headgear of the most enslaved slaves in the Roman Empire. Minister of war Jefferson Davis, a southerner and the later president of the Confederate States, was concerned that the pileus on the statue of freedom could be understood as a symbol of the Confederate State and ordered to replace it with a helmet. Delacroix's freedom figure also wore a pileus, and bartholdi first thought of providing his own figure with it. After all, he chose a crown as a headgear and thus avoid a reference to Marianne, who always wears a crown. The Siebenstrahlige Crown is the most original of ancient helios or sol depictions. It originally symbolizes the sun, but here are the seven oceans and the seven continents. Together with the torch, you should announce the message that freedom is lit up the world. Bartholdi early models were all the same from the concept: a female in the neoclassical style, representing freedom, carries a stole and a pella (dress and cape, common in depictions of Roman Goddesses) and holds a torch high. The face should have been modeled according to that of his mother, Charlotte Bey. Other sources call Isabella Eugenie Boyer, the wife of Isaac Merritt singer, as a model. Bartholdi designed the figure with an uncomplicated, Uncomplicated Silhouette. This should take off well from the setting of the port and the passengers would be able to perceive them from different angles when they approach Manhattan. He gave the figure classic contours and turned on a simplified way of modeling. This is what he wanted to meet the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose.

"{'context': 'In addition to changing the headgear of the statue, there were more changes, as the project developed. Bartholdi floated that the statue should hold a broken chain, but found that this could work in the period after the American Civil War. The Statue actually rises over a broken chain, but it is partially covered by the robe and is hard to perceive from the ground. Bartholdi was first hesitant about what the statue should hold in her left hand. His choice fell on a tabula ansata as a symbol of jurisprudence. He was a fan of the constitution of the United States, but for the inscription he chose July iv mdcclxxvi (July 4., 1776), which brought the date of the statement of freedom to the freedom of the freedom of expression.

One advantage of this procedure was that the statue would be light in proportion to its volume - the copper had to be only 2,4 millimeters thick.

Funding also came from less idealistic circles, who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build a canal. The Copper Trading company jappy frères donated the entire needed copper worth 64.000 francs. The Copper is supposed to come from a mine at visnes on the Norwegian Island of karmøy, but this could not be determined without doubt. Although the plans for the statue have not yet been completed, bartholdi started in the workshop of gaget, Gauthier & Cie. Make your head and your right arm with the torch. In May 1876, he travelled to the centennial exhibition as a member of the French delegation and made arrangements for a huge painting of the statue, which should be shown in New York as part of the centennial exhibition. The arm only met in Philadelphia in August, which is why he was not recorded in the catalogue. While some reports correctly identified the work, others were talking about the "" Colossal Arm "" (Colossal Arm) or "" Bartholdi Electric light "" (Bartholdi Electric Light).

After the end of the exhibition, the arm was transported to New York, where he was seen for several years at Madison Square Park, until he was returned to France to attach it to the statue. during his trip to the United States, bartholdi came in contact with different groups and urged the formation of an American Committee of the franko-American Union.

The fact that the constantino brumidi, born in Italy, had received the mandate for the decoration of the altarpiece, called for severe criticism, although the artist had now been naturalized. The Magazine Harper\'s weekly said that bartholdi could have donate both the statue and the base and the New York times presented: "" no true patriot can count any search for bronze in the present state of our finances."" (German: "" no true patriot can approve any expenses for women in the current situation of our finances."") in the face of this criticism, the American committee undertook several years. The Foundation for Bartholdi Statue should be set in the fort wood. This disused military base was created between 1807 and 1811 on bedloe\'s island. Since 1823, she has hardly been used, except for the military service, when the military was operating there. The Tena of the fortification factory had the shape of an eleven-Star Star. The Foundation and the base were aligned to the South-East, so that passengers, who were approached by the Atlantic Ocean, were able to perceive the statue. In 1881, the New York committee commissioned the architect Richard Morris hunt with the draft of the pedestal. Hunt presented a detailed plan and expected that the construction work would take about nine months. He proposed to build the base 114 Feet (34,75 meters) High. Confronted with financing, the committee reduced the height to 89 Feet (27,13 meters). Hunts socket design contains elements of classic architecture, including doric portals. The large mass is fragmented with architectural details, so that attention is drawn to the statue. The shape is a cut pyramid; the side side is at the base 62 Feet (18,90 meters), at the top 39,4 feet (12,01 meters). The four sides are identical in their appearance. Over the doors on each side there are ten golden discs, on which, according to a proposal, the emblem of the then 40 states should be placed, but what ultimately is going to be. There is a balcony covered by columns on each side. Close to the base of the pedestal, bartholdi placed a view point over which the statue itself rises. According to the writer louis also "" Summon [the socket] harsh up the power of the ancient Europe, which rises the dominant figure of the statue of liberty "" ("" craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over the dominating figure of the statue of the statue of the statue of the statue of liberty ""). The committee dedicated the former artist Charles Pomeroy Stone with the supervision of the construction work. The construction of the 15th foot (4,57 meters) deep foundation began on 9. October 1883, the foundation was built on August 5., 1884. According to hunts original concept, the pedestal of solid granite should consist. Financial considerations forced him to change his plan. The Final plan looked at up to 6 meters thick, with cement walls covered with cement walls. The produced concrete was the largest worldwide in the world. For this purpose, the German company dyckerhoff in amöneburg supplied 8000 barrels of Portland cement. The Statue of the statue began in 1882, and the committee organized a large number of events. Poet Emma Lazarus was asked to contribute with the donation of a work to such an event, an auction of works of art and manuscripts. She rejected first, with the reason that she could not write a poem about a statue. at that time, she was also busy with the help of refugees who fled anti-Anti-Antisemitic refugees in Eastern Europe. These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced. She saw a way to connect her compassion to the refugees with the statue. This resulted in the new colossus, including the symbolic lines "" give me your tired, your poor / your huddled masses to breathe free "" (German: "" give me your tired, your arms / your downtrodden masses, which will be longing for it, free to breathe "").', 'question': 'What did the panic of 1873 lead to?', 'answers': {'answer_start': [-1], 'text': ['An economic depression,']}, 'id': '0ada2a233c70f99013355b13877c19e6331f87f4'}"

In addition, nojima explained that the presence of speakers led to a number of changes in the history and the characters themselves to adapt the characters to the personalities of their speakers. However, the use of voice talk also led to problems. Since the cutscenes of the game of the Japanese voice talk were programmed accordingly, the English-speaking final fantasy x-Inception was facing the difficult task not only to create a suitable English translation, but also to the rhythm and temporal requirements of the characters of the characters adapt accordingly.

"{'context': 'Almost all stars of low and medium mass (below about nine m) end up as white dwarves, as soon as their offer of fuel has exhausted. These stars have previously spent most of their energy lifetime as a star. The period that a star spends on the sequence depends primarily on its mass, as the life span of a star with increasing mass continues to decrease. Since ik pegasi b exists as a white dwarf, it can be closed that he once has to have a bigger mass than his companion possessed. Therefore, at ik pegasi b, it is assumed that he once possessed a mass between 5 AND 8 M. to understand how it came to this stage of development, you have to look back on a few million years in the past. When the hydrogen was used in the core of the precursor star of ik pegasi b, its inner core moved together until it came to a new hydrogen burning in a bowl around its helium core, which led to a temperature in the inside of the star. In order to compensate the temperature, the outer coat expanded by a lot of the radius of a normal sun. The now heavily enlarged shell is turning off and thus formed the visible red-glowing outer shell characterized by a red giant. Once the core had reached a temperature and density, where it came to a fusion of the helium, the star moved further together and now belonged to a group of stars, located on a horizontal line on the hr chart. The Helium Fusion has formed an inner core of carbon and oxygen. When the helium was exhausted in the core, in addition to the outer bowl in which the hydrogen was burning, another bowl, in which the helium was now moved. The Star moved into an area within the hr chart, which the astronomers asymptotic giant (English). Nd Giant Branch, terms of agb). If the, of ik pegasi b had enough mass, it came in its core with the time to a carbon burning, with oxygen, neon and magnesium. In General, the outer shell of a red giant or agb star expands to the several hundertfache of the sun radius, (the pulsating agb star Mira, for example, achieves a radius of about 5 × 108 km (3 AE).) why this is also to be suspect for ik pegasi b. The Extension of the shell had the distance that the two stars of ik pegasi have on average today, so both had to share a common shell during this time.

"{'context': 'It is essential that ik pegasi a at a certain point have used the hydrogen in its core and a development path from the sequence to a red giant is going to go through. The surface of this red giant will then grow in such a way that its dimension exceeds the original radius around the hundertfache or more. at some point, the outer shell of ik pegasi a has extended so far that it exceeds the Roche border of its companion and makes a gaseous akkretionsscheibe around the white dwarf. This gas, which is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, leads to an increase in the size of its helium. Due to observations of similar objects, it can be assumed that the two stars, triggered by the massenaustausch, are constantly getting close to each other. According to the most likely development forecast, the gas-free gas is compressed on the surface of the white dwarf, after which it heats up until the merging gas has the necessary conditions for a water fusion from a certain point of view. This triggered a thermal reaction, in which a part of the gas will be removed from the surface. While its mass increases, only part of the accreted gas can be dropped, so that every cycle will continuously increase the mass of the white dwarf. As usual with a regular nova, the surface would also grow at ik pegasus b. Thus, (steady) Nova explosions are created, typical of a kataklysm variable star. During these phases, the brightness of the white dwarf will quickly increase by several magnitude sizes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a fainter is rs ophi, a star, which is also composed of a red giant and a white dwarf as a companion. At Rs Ophi, at least six times a recurrent (recurrent) Nova was observed between 1898 and 2006 every time the white dwarf had reached the critical value of its aufgesammelten mass of hydrogen, it came to a new explosive thermal reaction, which could then be observed as nova. However, various binaries go through an alternative development model, where the white dwarf succeeds in constantly making mass, without the fact that it is a nova event. Such narrow double triton are generally called type supersoft x-Ray Source (Cbss) (source with extremely soft radiation). with these objects, the transfer of the mass to its close white dwarf companion is low enough that a continuous fusion can be maintained without the incoming hydrogen on the surface in a fusion of helium burnt to helium. The Category of supersoft x-Ray source includes all high-pitched white dwarfs with a very high temperature temperature (0,5 × 10 6 TO 1 × 10 6 K.). Due to the steady intake of mass, such a white dwarf eventually approaches the chandrasekhar border of 1,44 M, from which the pressure-free pressure of the electron gas can no longer compensate the gravitational pressure and it has to come to the collapse. In the case that the core consists mainly of oxygen, neon and magnesium, this means that the white dwarf is usually only a fraction of its mass and the rest is finally falling into a neutron. If the core consists of carbon and oxygen, the increasing pressure and the rising temperature will launch a new carbon fusion in the center before the chandrasekhar border is reached. The episode would be a unstoppable arms that consumes a significant part of the mass within a short time and finally enough to apart the star in a huge type ia supernova explosion. But until this system will have reached a condition in which there could be a supernova explosion, the two objects will be in a considerably greater distance to the earth, because it is highly unlikely that the primary star, ik pegasi a, developed into a red giant in the immediate future. In order for a supernova event to pose a serious threat to life on earth, it must take place within a distance of approximately 26 light years to the earth. Only within this radius there is the possibility that the biosphere of the planet is influenced and in the extreme case the ozone layer of the earth could be destroyed. The speed of this star is currently 20,4 km / s relative to the sun, which corresponds to an increase in the distance from a lightyear every 14.700 years. After 5 million years, this star will be more than 500 Light-years away from the sun. A distance that is far enough outside the radius, within which a type ia supernova would pose a danger to our solar system. Following such a supernova explosion, the rest of the donor star (Ik Pegasus A) continues with the speed that he had once as a member of the star. The resulting relative speed to the galactic environment can be up to 100-200 km / s, which would make this celestial body one of the fastest objects of our galaxy.

Ganga finds itself in numerous legends from the mythology of Hinduism; the most famous is the one of her advent (Ganga Dhara-Murti): the wise (Rishi) Kapila had the sons of the king sagara because of their bad behaviors through a blazing beam from his eyes to ashes burned. A relative of the king had entrusted kapila, the redemptive dead ritual for the sons could only be completed with the help of ganga flowing as a milky way in the sky. However, only three generations later were born with bhagiratha someone who should be able to get ganga from the sky. He brought ganga to the place where his dead ancestors were lying, and their holy water redeemed them. Bhagiratha succeeded after many years of asceticism, so much inner strength and merit that the goddess appeared in front of him. However, she warned to get her to the earth - her water-free water levels would break the earth. Shiva alone is able to gently catch the water. A thousand years drove bhagiratha on the holy mountain of kailash, until shiva drove his help. When the water was swollen, the God made the impact with his hair and had the schwall over his long braiding in seven streams to the earth. India has had seven Holy Rivers since then. The Ganga is the holiest of these rivers and flows - after being watered down the north of India together with yamuna - in the gulf of Bengal in the Indian Ocean.

The concept of virtual memory was developed in 1956 by physicist Fritz-Rudolf Güntsch at the technical university of Berlin. In the UK, the concept of the atlas computer project by Tom Kilburn and colleagues in 1959 was demonstrated in a prototype. The computer came to the market in 1962 in the course of the 1960 s, the concept was based on most operating systems of mainframes (such as the tsos 70 of RCA or system / 360 (Model 67) and their successor system / 370 of IBM). As new hardware had to be developed for efficient implementation, there were still resistance in the 1960 s against a complete implementation in operating systems.
